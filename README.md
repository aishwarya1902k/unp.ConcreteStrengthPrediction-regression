#Concrete Strength Prediction



ABOUT THE DATA

The dataset contains information
regarding concrete strength and the
variables that influence it.

OBJECTIVE

The objective  is to develop predictive
models that can accurately estimate the
compressive strength of concrete based
on various input variables. 

THE PATH

Implementing multiple machine learning
models to fit the best model for the
dataset
